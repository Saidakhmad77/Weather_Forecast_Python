# Weather Forecast Application

Welcome to the **Weather Forecast Application**, a Python-based project that provides weather updates for any city worldwide. This application utilizes real-time weather data fetched from a public API and displays it in an easy-to-read format.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Get the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **City Search:** Enter any city to retrieve its current weather details.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and straightforward terminal-based output.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
2. An active internet connection to fetch weather data from the API.
3. A valid API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (or the weather API integrated into the project).

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saidakhmad77/Weather_Forecast_Python.git
   cd Weather_Forecast_Python
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your API Key:**
   - Open the `config.py` file (or the relevant configuration file where API keys are stored).
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python weather_forecast.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Enter the name of the city when prompted.
2. View the current weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
3. Repeat the process to get weather data for other cities.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap API (or similar weather API)
- **Libraries:** Requests, JSON, and other essential Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).
